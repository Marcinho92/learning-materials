1. General tips:
- don't be too vague
- highlight your skills and how you cooperate with teammates basing on your experiences
- don't say you never experienced certain situation, you can say how would you react in this situation


2. Low performer:
- what precisely was the problem
- who's fault is that he is low performer
- if it's not his fault then it's good idea to document what was frong for the puture possible problems

e.g. Pietrek and his problem with git or droping database
e.g. writing tests in pair programming


3. Team conflict:
- understand points of view of both sides

e.g. situation with Mariusz where he said the problem is with recalculate but problem was with calculate


4. Interest of company:

e.g. working in international team, 
e.g. taking part in whole process of creating software, from gatherin requirements to deploing and maintenance
e.g. working with known technologies but also with some new for me


5. Strong dissagreement:
- deeply understand both ideas
- attack ideas, not people
- you have to commit to what you decided even if it's not what you wanted

e.g. situation when I thought that bug was a result of last someone's deploy, but actually it was hidden bug made by me so I had to fix this
e.g. ??? situation with Mariusz where he said the problem is with recalculate but problem was with calculate


6. Sudden onboarding:
- having good documentation so new employee could install environemnt and get familiar with project
- make me available for new employee and his questions and explainign current situation that sometimes I can don't have time to respond immediately
- giving something simple to do, e.g. some simple bug to fix, or adding small, not crucial feature 


7. Work distribution:
- describe scope of work that was to be done,
- ask people about theit preferences, giving critical parts to most experienced employees


e.g. dividing regression test on several people


8. Past mistakes:
- describe problem
- say how did you handle it
- day what did you learnt from it

e.g. deploing new version with bug (mobilet), deploy changes on tst and akc but not to prd (insurance link4)


9. Challenging project:

e.g. insurance link4, developed mainly by me, my first microservice, dealing with external company and with frontend team


10. Production outage:
- stay calm, try find out what is the problem, if possible asm sb for help

e.g. problem with insurance link4 - problem with consents that came out after deploing sth else, but there was actually hidden bug


11. Tough feedback:

e.g. after problem with mobilet manager didn't sey to me directly about problem, but instead sey about it on meeting generaly how handle situations like that
e.g. when I haven't finiszed my aork at the end of the day my manger ask my to finish it at evening because I had whole day for doing it


12. Comfort zone:

e.g. changing work, changing position from QA to developer


13. Strengths and improvements
- 

e.g. i'm experienced in monolitic and microservices, in backend technologies, I was QA so I try to concentrate good tests coverage,
e.g. I could be better in designing system and in cicd
