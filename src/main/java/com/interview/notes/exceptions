Hierarchy of exceptions:
- Throwable
    . Error - represents unrecoverable errors that usually occur at the system level, such as OutOfMemoryError
        . AssertionError
        . OutOfMemoryError
        . StackOverflowError
    . Exception - represents recoverable errors and has several subclasses, such as RuntimeException and IOException
        . RuntimeException and its subclasses represent unchecked exceptions that do not need to be declared in a method's throws clause.
            . NullPointerException
            . IndexOutOfBoundsException
            . ArithmeticException
        . Checked Exceptions - must be declared in a method's throws clause or handled within the method using a try-catch block
            . IOException
            . SQLException
            . ClassNotFoundException
